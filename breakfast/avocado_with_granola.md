# Avocado with Granola
Less caloric than the banana pancakes, and just as delicious!

## Ingredients
- Half an avocado
- 150ml of Milk
- 2 Spoons of honey
- 120g of Granola

## Directions
Extract the juicy bit of the avocado out of its peel and pour it onto a blender.<br> 
Put the milk on top of it, and one spoon of honey too. <br>

Blend a little bit, then pour the other spoon of honey. <br>
The avocado green should brighten a little bit because of the milk, but the desired texture you're looking for should be of a mousse (kinda).<br>

Now just pick all of this and put in a bowl with the granola. Done!<br>

If your avocado wasn't that ripe, you may need to add a little bit more honey so it gets a little sweeter.
