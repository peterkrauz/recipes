# Banana Pancake
My favorite breakfast recipe by far - as of October 2021, at least. Serves (very well) a single person.

## Ingredients
90g of Oatmeal
10g of Protein Powder (1/3 of a whey scoop)
1x Egg
1x Banana 

## Directions
Split the banana in half and throw it inside a blender or something similar.<br>
Break the egg (no need to separate yolk) and put it right on top of the dismantled fruit.<br>
Pour the oatmeal (I usually measure three scoops of whey per medium-sized banana) on top of it all. <br>
Now the funny bit: the protein powder can make the dough feel a little like rubber. If you don't put any protein powder, it will get very very tender. If you put too much, it'll get weird.<br>
One third of a common whey scoop does the job for my taste.

Now blend it all until you can barely see the oatmeal flakes.

Put just a tiny little bit of butter in a frying pan, with low heat, and let the marvelous dough fall on top of it.<br>
Low heat means the pancake will have enough time to cook evenly and it won't burn that easy if you get distracted.<br>

Once you see the sides of the pancake starting to get a little solid **or** if you see discrete bubbles trying to flee the grasp of the dough, you can flip it so we cook the other side. <br>

Repeat the process above until you've finished cooking your pancakes! Peanut butter makes it ðŸ¤Œ so it's my personal recommendation.
